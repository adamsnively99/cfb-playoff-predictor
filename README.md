This project seeks to use S&P+ college football projections of team strength to 
project the most likely postseason matchups for a given season. This is achieved
by performing a Monte Carlo experiment by simulating a given season 1,000+ 
times.

This project allows users to display the program results in a Flask webapp, 
still in progress.
